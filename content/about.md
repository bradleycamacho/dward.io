I'm a technical documentation writer at [New Relic](docs.newrelic.com) with a heavy emphasis on internal open source strategy and workflows. I was an english major at UGA, so I love reading and writing - I mean, I did make it my career ;)

This is a personal blog/portfolio, which means you'll find post about random topics and also professional pieces. I love jumping between hobbies. Current ones that you'll probably find here are film photography, mechanical keyboard building, and plant-based cooking.
