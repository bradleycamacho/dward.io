I'm a technical documentation writer at [New Relic](docs.newrelic.com) with a heavy emphasis on internal open source strategy and workflows. I was an english major at UGA, so I love reading and writing - I mean, I did make it my career ;)

I also love taking my film photography, which means you'll find a few posts of film I've processed. I've recently started eating fairly plant based, so there will be quite a few pages documenting that journey.

This is a personal blog/portfolio, which means you'll find more than just recruiters care about (sorry recruiters!). I love jumping between hobbies. Current ones that you'll probably find here are film photography, mechanical keyboard building, and plant-based cooking. I'm going to have fun with this, so feel free to reach out with any comments or thoughts :)
